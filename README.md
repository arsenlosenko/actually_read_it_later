This extension is made to solve one and only one problem: forgetting about that article that you saved in your Pocket/Instapaper/Favorite Messenger/Whatever. 
The solution is simple: set reading time, add articles/links throughout the day, and you'll be reminded when you need! And it keeps saved data in sync, so you can save articles at work, and read at home.

How to add an article:

* Click on extensions icon
* You good to go!

How to set reading time:

* Go to options page
* Set time of the day you want to read
* And hit `Save`

How to remove an article: 

* It's pretty straightforward, click on `x` on the right from the article name
